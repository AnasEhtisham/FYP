"Project Scope: WordPress Website Build for a Furniture Company Overview This project involves the development of a new WordPress website for a school furniture company. The goal is to enhance brand awareness among furniture dealers by delivering a visually engaging, user-friendly platform that highlights the company’s product offerings without enabling eCommerce transactions. The website will be developed using the provided design assets, page templates, and pre-written content. Key Objectives • Build a new website on WordPress with integrated WooCommerce for product catalog functionality (without purchase capabilities). • Showcase the full range of school furniture products including seating, desks, tables, table/desk combos, and storage. • Position the company as a reliable, forward-thinking leader in school furniture. Core Features • WooCommerce Integration: Used solely as a product catalog, WooCommerce will enable the display of detailed product listings with updated photography. There will be no shopping cart or checkout functionality. • Content-Driven Pages: All non-product pages (e.g., About, Contact, Company History) will use established content and design templates. These will be provided in advance to the developer. • Dealer-Focused UX: Emphasis on clean layout, intuitive navigation, and fast access to visual information—critical for the decision-making process of school furniture dealers. • CMS Flexibility: WordPress will offer an easy-to-use backend for the internal team to update content and products independently. Design and Development Notes • All visual assets, UI design files, and page templates will be provided to the developer. • Staging Environment will be provided to the developer. • No original design work is needed beyond implementation. • Website structure and navigation will be modeled in part after the Paragon website, as preferred by the client. • Developers may use Elementor of Divi as themes and builders. Once decided we will provide the license key. Deliverables • Fully functional WordPress website coded to spec using provided design and content • WooCommerce product catalog with filtering and categorization • Backend configuration allowing easy updates by client • Launch-ready website optimized for desktop and mobile","Hi Bojrn, I’m a full-stack developer with 7+ years of experience specializing in WordPress, Elementpr, Divi, and E-Commerce development across Shopify, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce.

"I am looking for someone who will be able to create page mockups on Figma, then implement those designs on WordPress using page builders (most commonly Gutenberg, but sometimes WPBakery/Visual Composer), and be able to implement frontend tweaks from a JS/CSS level above what standard editor functionality will allow. It's essentially taking ownership of the design process, from concept to implementation. You will be provided design requirements and specifics (where they're known, e.g. sample sites or intended looks) and turn those into figma then iterate then implement then tweak, adding in your insights and design sense along the way. Ideally you're able to think outside the box (doesn't mean design weird stuff but sometimes as well), mainly in the sense of understanding the objectives of the site and what works well (not only looks good) to e.g. aim visitors to a specific outcome. Bringing more of the design side to it is a pro (e.g. being able to design graphics on the micro side of it, to having a more cohesive overall design sense in the macro), of course you'll also be responsible for implementing what you design as well. This will be for a mix of ecommerce (woocommerce) where shop pages will need to be designed, as well as informational (i.e. ""standard"") pages. Attention to detail is important, and while there will be separate QC involved, you'll be expected to consider consistency (fonts, spacing, colors, etc.) in your finished product. So that I know we're on the same page - since this is a combination role of designing, using page builders, and HTML/CSS/JS coding when required - please begin your message with the following statement: ""My skillset is definitely well-suited for both implementation & design; I have [no/little/average/significant] experience with designing where WooCommerce is involved, and the one page builder I am most experienced in is: [X]."" Please fill in ""X"" as appropriate, and as a matter of attention to detail, please (a) keep the square brackets around it, but (b) when selecting your level of experience with WooCommerce, choose only the option that applies to you, delete the other three (along with the square brackets), but keep the forward slashes.","Hi C. Jerilian, I am full-stack developer with 6+ years of experience.

From what I understand, the core challenge here is not just deploying DeepSeek R1, but building a self-learning AI system that continuously improves its knowledge of logistics data, optimizes freight management, and integrates seamlessly with external databases. How I Plan to Handle This Setting Up DeepSeek R1 – I’ll install and fine-tune it on the dual RTX 4090 setup, optimizing it for fast retrieval and remote access. Training it on logistics-specific data will be a priority to ensure relevant and accurate responses. Building the AI-Powered Seeker System – I’ll develop a FastAPI/Django-based API that connects with logistics platforms and continuously pulls real-time freight and operations data. The goal is to make AI retrieval fast, reliable, and adaptive to new data. Optimizing AI Learning & Automation – I’ll integrate reinforcement learning (RL) & RAG so the AI keeps improving as it processes more logistics data. I’ll also automate workflows like freight tracking, dispatch updates, and load status monitoring to reduce manual effort and improve efficiency. Why This is in My Wheelhouse I’ve fine-tuned and deployed LLMs like DeepSeek R1, GPT-4, and LLaMA for real-time automation before. I’m experienced in FastAPI, Django, Node.js, and building backend systems that integrate AI with structured & unstructured data. I understand logistics automation and have worked on projects involving AI-driven search, real-time tracking, and optimization workflows. Would love to hop on a quick call to go over the details and align on expectations. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Bests, Bilal"
I need someone who has an existing AI model or can quickly train or fine tune an AI model to pass gptzero.me. Please see the attached views.py file to see how this model should be plugged into my django app so that it will work when a user inputs any AI generated content. We need it to output 0% AI detection according to GPTzero.me,"Hi Cody, Thanks for the invitation. I saw the script. I actually did something similar to this in the past but the NDA was signed so I cannot share that right now. How about a quick chat or a call? I know you're looking for a quick turnaround.

"I need a set of Python scripts that can pull data from CSV files, sort and organize that data based on a matrix of seasonal models (each season identified with a unique name that links back to specific dates in a seasonal matrix file), and perform calculations based on the data associated with individual seasons. With the exception of one binomial distribution calculation, all of the calculations required are basic algebra. I have provided example Microsoft Excel files that both illustrate the expected output of these scripts and include the calculations that the Python script will need to perform. This script will be the basis of an expanded suite of forecast scripts, so every part of the script must be clearly and extensively commented/documented and each function must be able to operate independently so that it can be used in other scripts. Virtually all of the forecast functions in the script are performed for each seasonal model specified in the configuration file. These functions should be created such that they can loop through any number of iterations. I believe this is a simple, straightforward project for an experienced Python developer. I'm looking for clean, efficient, well-documented and well-formatted code. I estimate the entire project should take no more than 10 hours. I have attached a detailed set of instructions and the example Excel files that illustrate exactly what is required. REVIEW THESE FILES BEFORE APPLYING! I will require a Zoom interview to discuss the project, where you will need to prove to me that you have reviewed the files and have a thorough understanding of the project objectives and the functions of the scripts. I am looking to fill this position immediately and complete the project no later than Friday, March 21, 2025. DO NOT SUBMIT an AI-GENERATED COVER LETTER. You will be immediately rejected. Your cover letter needs to indicate that you have ACTUALLY reviewed the files. Tell me something about what I'm trying to do with these files that isn't explicitly included in this job description","Hi, I have a strong background in Python development, particularly in handling CSV files, data manipulation, and creating well-documented, efficient code.
