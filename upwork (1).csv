🔍 What We Need
We need someone experienced with:

Bubble.io
Fabric.js (image object control, drawing, masking, scaling)
Replicate API (especially Flux Sketch, Erase, Inpaint, Expand models)
JavaScript logic to manage two Fabric.js canvases (main + popup mask canvas)

🧠 Features We Want to Build
We're integrating AI editing features like:

🛠️ Fix (AI Inpainting) – [CURRENT TASK]
User selects an image → opens popup → draws mask → writes a prompt → image + mask + prompt sent to Flux Inpaint model → result returned and replaces the original image.

✏️ Sketch to Image
User draws rough sketch → sends with a prompt → Flux Sketch returns a polished, AI-generated result.

🧽 Erase (Object Removal)
User draws over unwanted areas → prompt + mask sent → Flux Erase returns a clean version without the object.

↔️ Expand (Outpaint)
User selects an image → expands canvas → draws + writes prompt → Flux Expand generates AI-filled surroundings.

✅ What’s Already Built
Bubble app with Fabric.js-based Canva editor
Popups with second Fabric.js canvas
JavaScript integration between main canvas and popup
Selection system with image metadata (url, width, height)
Working Replicate API connection (Flux models + BiRefNet for background removal)

❌ Problems We Need Help With
Making sure the popup canvas doesn't break or interfere with the main canvas
Ensuring image + canvas resize correctly to fit container while preserving aspect ratio
Avoiding “image not selected” bugs after popup is opened
Fully isolating popup canvas behavior (clean, reusable)
Handling drawing masks with correct scaling and positioning

🔧 Bonus If You Can Help With:
Supporting undo mask, reset, or image export workflows
Improving UX polish (tooltips, progress loaders, buttons)
Design consistency between canvases and app UI

⏱ Timeline
We’re mid-dev and need immediate help, especially with the Fix/Inpaint flow. Fast iteration and communication are key — ideally results in 2–4 days.

Project Overview
* Goal: Let customers pick any weekdays (Mon – Fri) for meal delivery, pay weekly, and manage everything in their dashboard.
* Design: Use a standard WooCommerce-compatible theme; our designer will restyle it later.
* Focus: Pure functionality—ordering flow, business logic, and admin screens. No custom visuals required.

2.  Requirements (What You’ll Build)
1. Postcode Validation – Check the customer’s postcode against a list we supply. If it’s invalid, log the postcode + email in the backend.
2. Meal Plan Selection – Two fixed plans: Small Portion and Big Portion.
3. Weekday Selection – Checkboxes for Mon-Fri (1–5 days). Future-proof: may expand to Mon-Sun.
4. 48-Hour Cut-Off [IMPORTANT]– Rolling cut-off at 9 AM (site time). Orders and edits must be at least 48 h before delivery.
5. Billing Logic – Charge at checkout for the current week, then charge weekly after each cut-off.
6. Store Credit – If a delivery is cancelled before cut-off, refund as store credit that expires after 6 months.
7. Customer Dashboard – Let users view deliveries, charges, store credit, and edit days (before cut-off).
8. Gift Vouchers – Customers can buy and redeem gift cards.
9. Admin Tools – View invalid postcode log, manage store credit, and edit meal plans.

3. Your Key Tasks
* Choose reliable original plugins (free preferred; paid OK—flag any licence costs).
* Implement or configure hooks/filters to enforce the 48-hour cut-off and weekly billing.
* Connect Stripe (test mode) and show that recurring charges trigger at the right times.

4. Must-Have Skills
* WooCommerce Subscriptions & Stripe integration
* PHP (hooks, filters, custom endpoints)
* WordPress best practices (child themes, security)
* Clear English documentation

5. Timeline 
* Start: Within 5 days of hire

6. User Flow (Example)
1. Visitor clicks “Order Now” on the homepage.
2. They enter their delivery postcode.
    * Outside service area: Show a message (“Your area isn’t in our delivery zone yet. Please leave your email and postcode—we’ll let you know when we expand.”) and log details.
    * Inside service area: Proceed.
3. Customer picks Plan 1 (small) or Plan 2 (big).
4. Customer selects delivery days.
5. Charging example:
    * Today is Tue 12 PM (cut-off was 9 AM).
    * Customer chooses Mon, Thu, Fri for the current “week”.
    * Only Fri qualifies (48 h ahead), so we charge for 1 day now.
    * After the next cut-off, we charge for Mon, Thu, Fri (3 days).
6. Customer can cancel or change a delivery until 48 h before. Refunded amounts become store credit, auto-applied to future bills and expiring in six months.


7. How to Apply
1. Provide some portfolio similar with this project.
2. List your proposed plugin .

What You’ll Do:
	•	Rapid Endpoint Generation: Use AI tools to spin up REST/GraphQL routes with input validation, error handling, and documentation.
	•	Schema & ORM Modeling: From plain-English data requirements, generate SQL/ORM models (Sequelize, SQLAlchemy, TypeORM) and migration scripts.
	•	Business Logic Implementation: Prompt AI to draft workflows (e.g., multi-step S3 uploads, queue consumers, event triggers) and refine edge cases.
	•	Automated Testing: Produce comprehensive unit/integration tests via AI-generated templates (Jest, PyTest, Mocha).
	•	CI/CD & DevOps: Write Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions or AWS CDK snippets using AI suggestions, then review and optimize.

Ideal Skills & Tools:
	•	Strong backend experience in Node.js, Python (Django/FastAPI), or Java (Spring Boot)
	•	Hands-on with at least one AI coding assistant: Copilot, CodeWhisperer, TabNine, or Replit Ghostwriter

I need to  a private tool that fully automates transactions on the Pi Network, which is a modified version of the Stellar blockchain.

🔹 Here’s Exactly What I Need:
1️⃣ Private Key Derivation Tool:
The Pi Wallet uses a 24-word passphrase (similar to BIP-39) but applies a custom/private derivation method to generate the keypair.

I need a script that will:

Input: My 24-word Pi Wallet passphrase.

Output: The correct private/public keypair compatible with Pi Network.

⚠️ Since Pi Network doesn’t expose this derivation publicly, this may require reverse engineering or prior knowledge of how Pi generates its keys.

2️⃣ XDR Transaction Builder & Signer:
After obtaining the keypair, I want a tool that can:

Build raw XDR transactions manually — without using Pi Wallet or Pi Browser.

Set custom parameters:

Exact transaction fee (e.g., force 0.02 Pi, while the wallet UI forces 0.01 Pi).

Destination address, amount, memo, etc.

Custom time bounds or advanced options if needed.

Sign the transaction using the derived private key.

3️⃣ Automated Transaction Submission (API-Based):
The signed transaction (XDR) must be submitted directly to Pi Network using its Horizon API (https://api.mainnet.minepi.com).

The key point is:

🚫 No interaction with the Pi Wallet UI or Pi Browser.
✅ The entire process must run through a script that:

Instantly builds, signs, and pushes transactions.

Executes transactions in under 1 second, giving me a competitive advantage.

🎯 Objectives:
Gain  control over:

Transaction fees.

Timing and speed.

All transaction parameters.

Completely bypass the limitations of the Pi Wallet interface and manual confirmations.

Ensure the tool is secure — everything runs locally, with no third-party servers involved.

⚡ Requirements:
Proven experience with:

Stellar SDK and Horizon API.

Blockchain key derivation techniques (especially non-standard/custom methods).

Crafting and signing XDR transactions.

Cryptography and secure handling of private keys.

(Bonus) Experience in reverse engineering wallet behavior or prior work with Pi Network.

If you’ve worked on similar blockchain automation tools, especially for Stellar forks or custom wallets, I’d love to discuss further.

Let me know if you're confident in delivering this solution, along with your estimated timeline and budget.

-One active property is a hyperlink which can open a new window when clicked
-Nodes should be rearrangeable, meaning they can be pinned when moved and the force direction stops on that node, so it's not always moving. I want to be able to arrange them as desired.
-Size and color of nodes defined by property, either by hex or preselected properties, meaning a specific name will always be a specific color.

We're currently working on a government contract and we're looking for a subcontractor.

TECHNICAL SUBMITTAL

I.	Objective.

The (CLIENT) is seeking to redesign and potentially host its public facing website to modernize and enhance its appearance and the presentation of content, with an anticipated go live of 9 months after the start date.

II.	Nature and Scope of the Project. 

The CLIENT’s current website was built internally and is currently hosted by an outside vender with a maintenance support contract. As a result, the outside vendor coordinates all technical upgrades and updates.

The new website will be designed and built by the selected Contractor.  The CLIENT may elect to receive the finished product for hosting in its own environment or by another source but may also elect to contract with the selected Contractor to host the completed website.

The new website does not need to reflect the style of the CLIENT’s current website.  It should be graphically redesigned to modernize and enhance the appearance of the pages. From an administrator perspective, creating and editing web content will be simplified to reduce web administration and support time, as well as overall site management time. The new website will be responsively designed, providing an equitable user experience on multiple platforms/environments.

Site administrators will have the ability to seamlessly upload, store, and display pages and other associated files for user viewing/download on the site. In addition, administrators will have a range of options for displaying content via multiple page templates. Content will be separate from presentation to allow for changes to the site’s graphic design over time, without the need to rewrite web code/content. Built into the site will be a system that enables the incorporation of visual displays of content, to include clickable county maps, data tables, pictures, videos, surveys, calendars, and dashboards. Additionally, the CLIENT’s social media platforms will be integrated into the site, expanding user participation and engagement with the CLIENT. From structure to content, the new website will meet state and federal requirements for public information and accessibility.

The selected Contractor and the CLIENT will collaborate throughout the  process to ensure the overall vision for the new website is obtained.  

III.	Requirements. 

The vendor will:
•	Utilize WordPress and Gutenberg blocks on a Pantheon platform. 
•	Have a solution in place to facilitate the data received by constituents through various online forms directly inputted into the Office of Attorney General’s CMS platforms on a daily basis.
•	 an accessible new website that provides visitors with the best and most efficient user experience possible. This will support the CLIENT in organizing and optimizing webpages, improving site navigation by making information and resources easier to find. Throughout this  phase, CLIENT reserves the right to add, alter or modify features as deemed appropriate by CLIENT to achieve the overall objectives of the design.
•	Facilitate data migration from the current system to the new system, which will be a standard process of set routines and workflow that may include re-keying information but could also allow cut/paste of current content to expedite the migration. This includes content, images, PDFs, videos and any other variables.  
•	Provide thorough training to select CLIENT staff that will also be available as recordings. If the new website is to be hosted by the Contractor, the training must be continuous per site upgrades/developments.
•	Include a Service plan which outlines technical website support and resolutions to issues during standard business hours (EST). Pending an emergency, the CLIENT must have access to a representative(s) that can provide/facilitate support. Online forums, training, skeletons, and comprehensive online documentation must be readily available.  
o	If/when the website must be down for maintenance, it must take place during overnight/early morning hours (EST) at a mutually agreed upon, specific timeframe. 
o	If/when the website is unexpectedly down, the Contractor will work to resolve the issue within the same day with the CLIENT.
o	Disaster Recovery and/or Pandemic recovery commitments must be clearly stated, including a description of Contractor’s capability to perform a complete restoration in the event of a disaster.
•	Facilitate timely software/system updates, and maintain site and data security. Additionally, audit trails of edits, session management, and SSL compatibility are necessary.
•	Describe controls for record retention and data destruction of data past retention periods, as well as how confirmation of data destruction will be provided.
•	Confirm that the CLIENT’s data will, under no circumstances, be directly or indirectly transmitted or downloaded to, stored in, or accessible from any location that is not subject to the laws and jurisdiction of the United States.
•	Describe if the proposed hosting platform is a dedicated single tenant or shared (multi-tenant) server or cloud instance and describe the security controls related to the hosting platform. 
•	Specify any software/product that must be purchased by the CLIENT to support the site in the event the CLIENT chooses to host the site itself.
•	Insure all redirects are in place for changed URLs to sustain existing SEO value of pages.

The new website will:
•	Allow various devices to equitably view website content via responsive design.
•	Meet state and federal requirements for public information and accessibility.
•	Be compatible with all operating systems.

The new website’s CMS (WordPress) will:
•	Provide a standard set of features and functionality to easily create, view, maintain, support, and produce website content on multiple device platforms, as well as provide a framework for adding custom functions to improve the versatility of the website.
•	Offer administrators a seamless process to upload large files/documents, imagery, and other content to the website for public access.
•	Have the ability to expand/extend the original framework into a more comprehensive web solution.
•	Allow for social media feeds, a web-based translation manager, and a form function. 
•	Feature administrative tools that are user-friendly and flexible with common word processing functions for editing and formatting, adding links and graphics, and overall page management. 

The CLIENT will:
•	Manage/facilitate all content-specific updates (i.e., page text, imagery) to the website once it is live, even if Contractor hosted.
•	Reserve the right/ownership to all content displayed on the website. If the new website is to be hosted by the Contractor, upon expiration of the contract or at any time at the written request of the CLIENT, all data must be returned to the CLIENT in a format agreed to by the CLIENT.

Work on the new website shall begin upon execution and delivery of the purchase order. The new website will go live 9 months after a mutually agreed upon date determined by the CLIENT and the Contractor.   To go live, the CLIENT must be confident that the solution will meet the majority/priority needs for its website and associated management – this will be achieved by testing, demonstrating, and vetting the solution with a project management team within the CLIENT. The CLIENT must then be confident that after participating in training facilitated by the Contractor, it will be able to easily manage and update content on the website moving forward.  If the finished product is being delivered to the CLIENT (as opposed to being hosted by the Contractor), a mutually agreeable schedule must be determined for migrating the finished product.

✅ 2. Reed Connect Module (Add-On)
Reed access will originate only from Frank’s PC (local use due to licensing).

AI will scan Reed daily for new projects in CO/UT.

Same processing flow as GC invites (download → scan → act).

Treat as a parallel lead source—not a replacement for GC invites.

✅ 3. Proactive Contractor Outreach
AI sends regular emails to contractors and subs in CO/UT.

Example: “Are you working on any projects where Cascadia Clip might be a fit?”

Replies are logged.

Matching projects become new deals.

Contractor is added to call list and follow-up sequence begins.

The ideal candidate will have a strong understanding of PHP, MYSQL Databases and experience with website optimization. 

Below are the updates we are in need of:
1 - Two players play in a 1v1 basketball game. Each game consists of three rounds to 21 points. Currently the winner is whoever scores the most points after the 3 rounds but we need the winner to be whoever won 2 out of the 3 rounds. For example round one score could be 
Player A 20 & Player B 21. 
Round 2 Player A 19 & Player B 21
Round 3 Player A 21 & Player B 10.
From this example you can see the website will currently give the win to player A as he scored 60 points while Player B scored 52. But we need the winner to be Player B as he won 2 out of the three rounds. We need the results to sort by wins and subsort by point differential as a few players could have the same amount of wins.

2 - Currently the players do not have a way to add their own scores from the game. On the schedule page on the right side of the game information we need an update link that takes them to a page where they can enter the scores for the 3 rounds, their 3 point score and Free throw score.

3 - On the players page it currently lists their name, image and scheduled games. We'd like to add a few stats to their individual player page such as: Record, games played, points scored, points allowed, point differential, Rank for overall, rank for grade and rank for division.

 If you are detail-oriented, reliable, and can work independently, we would love to hear from you & we can show you the website to take a look before finalizing your bid. Thanks!","developer","","","Web Development","PHP","WordPress","HTML","CSS","MySQL","15 to 20",""
